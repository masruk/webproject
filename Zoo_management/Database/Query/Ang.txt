Zoo Authority arranged a nice angling spot which is open all through the day. The visitors can get chance to enjoy a quality time here. Since there is also a boat riding option, so there are
multiple ways for people to come in and have a great time and connect with the animals dweling in the water. There also all sorts of angling equipment available here so that the convenience
of use is maintained. Really it's a good place for anglers.
